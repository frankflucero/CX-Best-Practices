Designing a World-class Digital CX Program - Qualtrics

Customer journey mapping is a major component of any customer experience program - a key part of mapping the CX is identifying key moments/interactions that shape brand perception and loyalty.  For SaaS this is online via in-app, website, etc. and across platforms – Mobile, iPad, etc…
But to truly optimize the CX onsite, you will need to talk directly to the customer so as to fill in the gaps left by analytics alone.

With this picture of the ctm’s experience we need to look for the following:
-	Why is the person behaving this way?
-	What was the initial purpose of their visit to the site, and were they successful?
-	Did this onsite experience create a loyal customer?
-	Is this customer likely to come back to this site?
-	What other touchpoints are taking place outside of the website experience?

Many organizations look at the digital experience as a singular event when it is a series of different journeys that determine the CX.  For example, was it a consumer coming to buy something that caused the positive interaction? Or was it a consumer coming to get support?  Was it our touch point interactions that resulted in the purchase or them doing their own competitive research and choosing us?

1.	Track and analyze potential and existing issues within the CX.
a.	What are the common journeys – Buy, Help, Manage Acct, Learn, etc?  Which are effective and which are problematic
b.	In order to properly diagnose the effectiveness of specific journeys, you will want to capture some key, high-level metrics around the overall site experience. Some of these metrics include:
i.	Goal attainment of the visitor: primary purpose of the visit and its success
ii.	Likelihood they will recommend site – NPS
iii.	Likelihood they will return to site
iv.	What are the key drivers that are impacting overall site experience (viewed through the lens of your key metrics)
v.	What are the primary pain points visitors are experiencing
c.	Persistent “opt-in” feedback is particularly helpful for identifying key pain points on the site, but most of your research-based questions around key metrics should be saved for the overall site experience study.  Thus the best methodology for engaging with a site visitor is a combination of an overall site experience study on exiting of the website and persistent feedback on all pages.
2.	Dive deep into the key journeys to gain granular actionable journey specific insights – the “track/diagnose stage above is good for high level problems; Actionable Data comes from in-journey research

This stage is where you should ask targeted questions to a visitor that is engaged with a specific journey so you can more effectively see the journey through the eyes of the consumer and understand how to fix the problem.

Sample journey:

-	PROVIDE CONTENT / FEEDBACK
-	CONNECT WITH OTHERS / COMPANY
-	ENJOY / EXPERIENTIAL
-	LEARN
-	MANAGE ACCOUNT
-	SUPPORT / GET HELP
-	CART / BUY

Gaining customer perspective in moments of pain within that journey can be priceless. Obtaining access to these key moments and addressing the issues in a timely and relevant way will give you the ability to turn detractors into promoters.  Here are examples of how:
-	“WALK” THE COMMON JOURNEYS YOURSELF FOCUSING ON THE PROBLEM JOURNEYS.  Ensure you play the role of the different ICP’s and are unbiased.  
-	Check your analytics for high idle rate or abandon rate
-	Check your persistent feedback to identify common pain areas

Determine the characteristics of your visitors to compile demographic breakdowns and insights from these demographics.  You can then improve CX by having personalized content and survey questioning.

So now we should understand:
1. Why visitors are coming to your site.
2. What journeys are allowing visitors to be successful, driving repeat visitors, and promoting loyalty.
3. Where potential pain points exist within problematic journeys.

Next step is to gather in-journey data for actionable insights on how to fix issues.  This will require tech that will allow you to target specific users engaged in that journey

In-journey research includes:
-	Usability testing
-	Visitor profiling
-	Product / pricing research (are you finding what you’re looking for?)
-	Targeted “help” interactions
-	A / B testing
-	Page / product specific feedback
-	Abandonment studies
-	Post-transaction research
-	Content effectiveness studies
-	Omnichannel assessments

YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL ON HOW YOU ENGAGE THE CTM FOR INSIGHTS TO NOT RUIN THE UX RESULTING IN AN UPSET CTM.  This can be addressed by following these practices:
1.	Balancing Active [requesting input] and Passive [opt-in input ever present on site] engagements.  Note Active approach is better for gathering input via a representative sample and good for NPS and CSAT, etc.  However, it can be bad for CX.  YOUR ALSO NEED TO WATCH REPEATED DISPLAY THUS FREQUECY EVERY 6 MONTHS.  Passive/Opt-in input is not very representative as there are more negative inputs but it is helpful to gain specific pain points on the site.  THE PASSIVE DISPLAYS SHOULD BE ON EVERY PAGE TO GAIN COMPLETE SITE PAIN POINTS.
2.	For active approaches, escalate from discreet to indiscreet – try discreet input schemes first and if input not ample go to indiscreet but watch CX.
a.	The point in the funnel where the Intercept occurs [info-bar, slider, popover] needs to be in the most painful points
3.	Watch repeated displays – every 6 months, etc. but will need to play with this.
4.	Be precise in what you ask (3-5 questions in journey). While it may seem like a good idea to ask everything you have on your mind while you have an engaged site visitor that is willing to talk to you, it is bad practice.
5.	Engage right visitors at the right time. Be sure that you are asking questions to a relevant audience within a relevant journey.  Examples of in-journey event triggers:
a.	Buy - abandonment, purchase confirmation
b.	Learn - scroll, login, type of content being consumed, abandonment
c.	Manage Account - login, logout, user-profile, url visited
d.	Get Help - repeat visits, geo-location, visitor profile
e.	Enjoy - site referrer, time on site
f.	Provide Content - page referrer, current URL
g.	Connect with Others - number of pages visited, IP address, cookie parameters

TO KNOW WHERE TO INTERCEPT CTMS IN THE JOURNEY YOU NEED TO LOOK AT YOUR ANALYTICS TO DETERMINE HIGHEST PAIN POINTS [HIGH EXIT OR BOUNCE RATE] OR PAGES IN THE FUNNEL WITH HIGH VOLUME OF PERSISTENT FEEDBACK.

6.	Be sure that every interaction reflects your brand.  Does your feedback UX reflect your brand or your vendor’s brand?
7.	Consider your audience when asking these questions—use language that is digestible and engaging. Make your questions relevant to the visitor with personalized lines of inquiry.

TIPS FOR SAMPLING:

-	You can get a representative sample by understanding how many unique visitors visit your site, or are in a specific journey.  You can use the Qualtrics sample rate calculator to figure out your ideal sample size:  https://www.qualtrics.com/blog/calculating-sample-size/
-	If you are not getting the sample size responses you need you can do the following:
o	If possible, use embedded survey targets (survey inside of the creative) instead of clickable links. This will reduce the amount of steps required to provide feedback
o	Is your targeting criteria too restrictive? You can still target a very specific audience, however your sample rate will have to increase.
o	Sample rate is a key lever that can dramatically impact total responses when increased or decreased.
o	The messaging used on your invitation makes a significant difference. One impactful idea is to phrase your feedback solicitation in terms of questions asked, not time required. For example, turn “Do you have five minutes to provide us with feedback?” into “Please answer these five questions to help us improve your site experience.”
o	Length of survey will dramatically impact completion rates. In a transactional environment (like on the website), never ask more than 8-10 questions around overall site experience and never more than 3-5 for journey specific research.
3.	CLOSE THE LOOP - To close the loop is not only to let customers know that you have heard their feedback but also to bring the customer’s voice right inside the organization.
a.	ALERTS when issues age or deadlines not met to owner.  Note it is key to identify the correct owner and ensure they are engaged at the right level.
b.	TARGETED HELP INTERACTIONS
c.	REAL-TIME REPORTING on dashboards
d.	TICKET MANAGEMENT – track issues and raise flags
e.	Prioritize issues – Macro [ex: Journey specific issues] and Micro [TS Issue] separately.  For low volume not-strategic ctm use non-human interactions and VV.
Priority elements include: Average cart value; Repeat visitor; Spend per year; Subscription status; Visitor profile (are they your target market?)

To summarize, here are the best practices for close loop management:
1. Ensure those who are responsible for closing the loop are empowered to delight the customer.
2. Establish rules to prioritize high-value vs. low-value visitors and triage tickets appropriately.
3. Use technology to improve experiences for low-value customers.
4. Macro fixes will have the biggest blast radius. Focus here first, then follow through on the micro-level.
5. Use the data to drive change, not just monitor metrics.
6. Get senior leaders involved.
